  author    = "Frazier, Peter I",
  abstract  = "Bayesian optimization is an approach to optimizing objective
               functions that take a long time (minutes or hours) to evaluate.
               It is best-suited for optimization over continuous domains of
               less than 20 dimensions, and tolerates stochastic noise in
               function evaluations. It builds a surrogate for the objective
               and quantifies the uncertainty in that surrogate using a
               Bayesian machine learning technique, Gaussian process
               regression, and then uses an acquisition function defined from
               this surrogate to decide where to sample. In this tutorial, we
               describe how Bayesian optimization works, including Gaussian
               process regression and three common acquisition functions:
               expected improvement, entropy search, and knowledge gradient. We
               then discuss more advanced techniques, including running
               multiple function evaluations in parallel, multi-fidelity and
               multi-information source optimization, expensive-to-evaluate
               constraints, random environmental conditions, multi-task
               Bayesian optimization, and the inclusion of derivative
               information. We conclude with a discussion of Bayesian
               optimization software and future research directions in the
               field. Within our tutorial material we provide a generalization
               of expected improvement to noisy evaluations, beyond the
               noise-free setting where it is more commonly applied. This
               generalization is justified by a formal decision-theoretic
               argument, standing in contrast to previous ad hoc modifications.",

  abstract = 	 {Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful paradigm for efficient optimization of black-box objective functions. High-dimensional BO presents a particular challenge, in part because the curse of dimensionality makes it difficult to define—as well as do inference over—a suitable class of surrogate models. We argue that Gaussian process surrogate models defined on sparse axis-aligned subspaces offer an attractive compromise between flexibility and parsimony. We demonstrate that our approach, which relies on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for inference, can rapidly identify sparse subspaces relevant to modeling the unknown objective function, enabling sample-efficient high-dimensional BO. In an extensive suite of experiments comparing to existing methods for high-dimensional BO we demonstrate that our algorithm, Sparse Axis-Aligned Subspace BO (SAASBO), achieves excellent performance on several synthetic and real-world problems without the need to set problem-specific hyperparameters.}
