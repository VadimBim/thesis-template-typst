# Master Thesis 

My master thesis written in [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst). I used the [thesis template of Technical University of Munich](https://github.com/ls1intum/thesis-template-typst) as a starting point.

### Build PDFs locally 
Once you have installed Typst, you can use it like this:
```sh
# Creates `thesis.pdf` in working directory.
typst compile thesis.typ

# Creates PDF file at the desired path.
typst compile thesis.typ path/to/output.pdf
```

You can also watch source files and automatically recompile on changes. This is
faster than compiling from scratch each time because Typst has incremental
compilation.
```sh
# Watches source files and recompiles on changes.
typst watch thesis.typ
```

## Working with the Typst Web Editor

If you prefer an integrated IDE-like experience with autocompletion and instant preview, the Typst web editor allows you to import files directly into a new or existing document. Here's how you can do this:

1. Navigate to the [Typst Web Editor](https://typst.app/).
2. Create a new blank document.
3. Click on "File" on the top left menu, then "Upload File".
4. Select all .typ and .bib files along with the figures provided in this template repository.

**Note:** You can select multiple files to import. The editor will import and arrange all the files accordingly. Always ensure you have all the necessary .typ, .bib, and figures files you need for your document.
